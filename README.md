Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Roger, and I live in South Africa.:south_africa:

I have past programming experience in C++ and Java, but now work as a Javascript developer.

I have past experience in scientific toolmaking in support of infectious disease research (mathematical modelling at both the biological and epidemiological level), but now work in financial technology.

I have wide interests in both the sciences and the humanities, including but not limited to:
* Mathematics
* Computer Science
* Physics
* Music (eclectic appreciation - but don't play any instrument)
* Psychology
* Philosophy
* Comparative religion

Consider me an all-round curious character.

I am an INFP. I used to think I was INTP, but I now see that doesn't fit properly.

My Big5 Traits are: 
* Openness: high and happy with it.
* Conscientiousness: lowish and working on increasing.
* Extraversion: low and happy with it.
* Agreeableness: high and mostly happy with it.
* Neuroticism: highish and working on decreasing.

âš¡ I am an Emacs zealot, but I don't proselytize.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [Julia](https://julialang.org/) because I think it will be a good fit for the types of personal project I'm interested in pursuing - some of which I will be hosting on this GitHub account in the medium term.
